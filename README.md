# Cairn Outdoor Co. — Agentforce Voice Demo

Salesforce DX project for a live-build **Agentforce Voice** demo, recorded for the
[CodeWithSally](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeWithSally) YouTube channel. Built with
Cursor and Claude Code.

The scenario: **Cairn Outdoor Co.**, a fictitious direct-to-consumer outdoor gear
retailer whose call center runs on Amazon Connect + Salesforce Service Cloud Voice
with two human-only queues (English and Spanish). The demo adds an Agentforce Voice
service agent in front of that stack — order lookup grounded in a Data360 data graph,
company FAQs and product Q&A grounded in real Knowledge articles and product manuals
via Data Cloud vector search, and escalation to a human agent or case creation when
the agent can't help.

Each grounding approach is built in stages on camera, so the demo shows _why_ each
upgrade matters — see [`docs/REQUIREMENTS.md`](docs/REQUIREMENTS.md) §5.

- **What we're building**: [`docs/REQUIREMENTS.md`](docs/REQUIREMENTS.md) — the
  fictitious scenario, sample data spec, and agent use cases.
- **How we're building it**: [`docs/SETUP_GUIDE.md`](docs/SETUP_GUIDE.md) — org
  setup, data loading, agent build steps, run-of-show for the recording.
- **The five hours**: [`docs/presentations/`](docs/presentations/) — one short deck
  per session. Repo tracked at [github.com/dangt85/sally-afv](https://github.com/dangt85/sally-afv).

## The five sessions

Each hour has a before branch and an after branch. Check out the before branch at
the start of that hour. The after branch is where the hour lands. The next hour's
before branch is the same commit as this hour's after branch. `main` is the end of
hour 5.

| Hour | Before                             | After                             | What lands                                                                                                                                         |
| ---- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | `show/01-before-a-person-answers`  | `show/01-after-a-person-answers`  | Amazon Connect and Salesforce Voice. A person answers. No agent.                                                                                   |
| 2    | `show/02-before-the-agent-answers` | `show/02-after-the-agent-answers` | Compass greets, then transfers to the person from hour 1.                                                                                          |
| 3    | `show/03-before-wheres-my-order`   | `show/03-after-wheres-my-order`   | Orders. A known caller is recognized by phone. An unknown caller proves the order. The lookup is the Flow.                                         |
| 4    | `show/04-before-return-policy`     | `show/04-after-return-policy`     | The return policy, from the FAQ articles. The hour builds the prompt-template retriever on camera, then leaves the faster Apex retriever in place. |
| 5    | `show/05-before-the-manual`        | `show/05-after-the-manual`        | A product question from the manual, then order lookup moves to the data graph.                                                                     |

Hour 5's after branch is `main`. Agentforce Contact Center is the coda in the hour 5
deck, not a sixth branch.

## Architecture

Two views of the same Compass agent. Amazon Connect is the phone system in the
build. Agentforce Contact Center is the alternate, with Salesforce as the phone
system.

### Salesforce + Amazon Connect

### Agentforce Contact Center

### Call and escalation

A call reaches Compass through Amazon Connect and Service Cloud Voice. Compass
answers when Data 360 can ground it. When it cannot, Compass escalates the live
call into the topic's queue, and a representative picks up in Salesforce.

```mermaid

    autonumber
    actor Caller
    participant Connect as Amazon Connect
    participant Voice as Service Cloud Voice
    participant Inbound as Cairn Inbound
    participant Compass
    participant Data360 as Data 360
    participant Omni as Omni-Channel
    actor Rep as Representative

    Caller->>Connect: Call Cairn
    Connect->>Voice: Hand off the audio and caller number
    Voice->>Inbound: Open the new VoiceCall
    Inbound->>Inbound: Find a Person Account by phone

    alt Exactly one Person Account
        Inbound->>Voice: Save the Account and first name on the VoiceCall
    else No match, or more than one
        Inbound->>Inbound: Leave the caller unknown
    end

    Inbound->>Compass: Route the VoiceCall to Compass
    Compass->>Caller: Greet the caller
    Caller->>Compass: Ask for help
    Compass->>Compass: Router sends the turn to one topic
    Note over Compass: Order lookup chooses Orders and Returns. Company FAQ and product Q&A choose Customer Support.
    Compass->>Data360: Look up the order, article, or manual
    Data360-->>Compass: Return a grounded result, or nothing useful

    alt The result answers the question
        Compass->>Caller: Speak the answer from that result
    else The topic cannot resolve it
        Compass->>Caller: Say which specialist is taking the call
        Compass->>Omni: Escalate the live call
        Note over Compass,Omni: Telephony plays "I'm transferring you now to a Cairn representative..."
        alt A representative is available
            Omni->>Connect: Place the call in the topic's queue
            Connect->>Rep: Offer the call
            Rep->>Caller: Pick up in Salesforce
        else Nobody is available
            Omni-->>Compass: The transfer did not connect
            Compass->>Caller: Confirm a short summary of the issue
            Compass->>Compass: Create the case
            Compass->>Caller: Read back the case number
        end
    end
```

The router never answers. It only sends the caller to Order Lookup, Company FAQ,
or Product Q&A, and that topic sets the queue before it tries to help. Escalation
is a separate hand-off: the topic tells the caller and invokes the transfer in
the same turn. On Agentforce Contact Center the same Compass path applies, and
the queue stays inside Salesforce instead of returning to Amazon Connect.

## Orgs

Two Salesforce **sandbox** orgs, aliased as below:

| Alias        | Purpose                                         |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `sally-prep` | Build and rehearse everything here first.       |
| `sally-demo` | Kept clean; built from scratch live, on camera. |

```bash
sf org login web --alias sally-prep
sf org login web --alias sally-demo
```

Always pass `--target-org sally-prep` or `--target-org sally-demo` explicitly when
running `sf` commands against a specific org.

## Prerequisites

- **Salesforce CLI** (`sf`). Download and install it from
  [developer.salesforce.com/tools/sfdxcli](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/sfdxcli).
- **VS Code** with the **Salesforce Extensions** pack and the **Agentforce DX**
  extension — see
  [Install Pro-Code Tools](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/ai/agentforce/guide/agent-dx-set-up-env.html)
  — or **Cursor** / **Claude Code** for the pro-code build (see `CLAUDE.md`).
- Both sandbox orgs Agentforce- and Data Cloud (Data360)-enabled, with Person
  Accounts enabled and an Amazon Connect instance already wired up via Salesforce
  Service Cloud Voice. Full prerequisite list in
  [`docs/SETUP_GUIDE.md`](docs/SETUP_GUIDE.md#1-prerequisites).

## Deploying Metadata

```bash
sf project deploy start --target-org sally-prep
```

## Enable Skills in Agentforce Vibes to Vibe Code Agents

To vibe code agents using Agentforce Vibes, first open the Agentforce Vibes panel.
Click the **Manage Skills, Rules, Workflows, and Hooks** icon, then the **Skills**
tab, and ensure these skills are enabled:

- `developing-agentforce`
- `observing-agentforce`
- `testing-agentforce`

### Using Cursor or Claude Code Instead

If you prefer Claude Code or Cursor over Agentforce Vibes, copy these skills from the
`sf-skills` GitHub repository into the appropriate directory for your tool:

- [`developing-agentforce`](https://github.com/forcedotcom/sf-skills/tree/main/skills/developing-agentforce)
- [`observing-agentforce`](https://github.com/forcedotcom/sf-skills/tree/main/skills/observing-agentforce)
- [`testing-agentforce`](https://github.com/forcedotcom/sf-skills/tree/main/skills/testing-agentforce)

## What's Inside This DX Project?

The project was scaffolded from Salesforce's Agentforce DX starter template. That
template's sample agent (**Local Info Agent**) and its example Apex/Flow/prompt
components have been removed — everything below is Cairn Outdoor Co.'s own build.
